            In 1999, I was born. Not long after that, my mom started telling me
            that I would make a great engineer. She noticed that I liked solving
            problems, building things, taking things apart, fixing things, I was
            good at math...you get the picture. She encouraged me to pursue what
            I was good at and what I liked doing. So, at some point, I decide
            that one day I would be an engineer.
        </p>
        <p>
            I didn't write a single line of code in highschool. So, when it came
            to picking a major, the only reason I even considered a CS degree
            was because I was technologically inclined and becuase my favorite
            class up to that point had been, what my highschool called,
            "Technology", which was essentially Photoshop and Excel for
            beginners.
        </p>

        <p>
            I caught on to PS pretty quickly, so once I learned the basics, I
            designed
            <a
                href={forFun.src}

                >this very Material-Design-looking UI</a
            ><i> for fun</i>. That's a mockup of a to-do app homepage that I
            designed in Photoshop and literally exported as <code
                >FOR FUN.jpeg</code
            >. When I wasn't learning <a
                href="https://youtu.be/QTjeV_2z_LY?si=owkT-8_Q3eub1BOH"
                target="_blank"
                >magic tricks</a
            >, that's apparently what I was doing for fun in 2016.
        </p>

        <p>
            I had rooted (and bricked and then revived) multiple Androids at
            this point and spent ridiculous amounts of time designing my mobile
            software experience through launchers, icon packs, and custom ROMs.
            <b> I was a UI/UX designer at age 17</b>, but I didn't know that was
            a thing, so I was still convinced I was going to be an engineer.
        </p>
        <p>
            So did I pick a CS degree or an engineering degree? Yes. Software
            Engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
            Software Engineering at ONU, as a major, split ENGR and CSIS courses
            50/50 and existed for maybe 6 years. Myself and the 6 other software
            engineering majors of 2021 were the last to graduate from ONU. The
            engineering half of my college education has become arguably useless
            and the computer science half prepared me to work on
            microcontrollers and write Java...which did not excite me.
        </p>
        <p>
            What did excite me? As a project for my year-long sophomore Java
            course, we had to replicate the classic Simon game using <a
                href="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/7p2whiua/production/fbc71c08c5e80094d71e416b14ee3085ed390345-2048x1536.jpg?w=900&auto=format"
                target="_blank"
                >NXT robots</a
            >. I completed the project in record time. Then I spent about twice
            as long designing the monochromatic pixel art that displayed the
            player's level, the high score, and the navigation menu. That was
            not required work; I just got really passionate about it for some
            reason. In my Android development course, I discovered <a
                href="https://medium.com/google-design/designing-adaptive-icons-515af294c783"
                target="_blank"
                >adaptive icons</a
            >. Fun fact, on Andoird O and later, every app icon can be multiple
            layers and they can react to your scolling in an elastic-like
            animation, which is so cool and satisfying. I enjoyed designing
            those silly little icons more than actually programming the apps.
            Again, we weren't required to create adaptive icons for our apps and
            our prof never taught us about them; I was just passionate.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, senior year rolled around. I needed some filler classes to
            be considered a full time student and be allowed to live on campus.
            I added an art/programming course to my last semester of college. We
            developed a 2D scroller game, and 3D kart racing game in Unity, an
            app prototype in Adobe XD, and two websites: one to sell something
            that we could offer as an individual and one to display all our
            projects from the course. I was hooked! The game development
            projects didn't really speak to me, but I was incredibly excited
            about app prototyping and web development because they clicked. I
            understood the course material with ease and my projects were miles
            ahead of my classmates'. Surprisingly, I was the guy helping my
            classmates instead of the guy asking his classmates for help (which
            was usually the case).
        </p>
        <p>
            The year prior to this class, I went home for spring break and never
            came back, due to COVID. During that whole "stay at home or you'll
            die and if you don't die you'll kill someone else" summer of 2020, I
            started an online clothing store through Shopify. I only mention
            this because it was a huge part in discovering my passion for web
            development/design. I loved designing each page of the website, even
            though it was tedious. I grew passionate about content layout,
            interaction animations, and user experience through this project. At
            this point, I still hadn't really written in any web development
            languages because I could do most of what I wanted through Shopify
            or their plugins. But, this was my first taste of HTML, CSS, and
            Javascript because every once in a while they were required to get
            my vision for a page pixel perfect.
        </p>
        <p>
            The rest really is history. Senior year I went deep down the web dev
            and UI design YouTube rabbit holes and, shortly after graduating,
            somehow got the job I'm at now where I'm still constantly learning
            and feel totally incompetnant next to my much more experienced
            coworkers.
